      <p class="skill-row">Then throw her in the laundry room, which will hereafter be referred to as “the brig”. Kids have names? Come, Comrade Bender! We must take to the streets! Shut up and get to the point! Have you ever tried just turning off the TV, sitting
        down with your children, and hitting them? Who are those horrible orange men? Son, as your lawyer, I declare y’all are in a 12-piece bucket o’ trouble. But I done struck you a deal: Five hours of community service cleanin’ up that ol’ mess
        you caused.
